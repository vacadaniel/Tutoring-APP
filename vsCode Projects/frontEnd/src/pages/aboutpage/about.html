        Our tutoring platform connects students with tutors from their own school. Tutors can create profiles, select their school, list subjects they tutor, set hourly rates, and manage availability. Students can browse tutors, filter by subject and rating, and book sessions.

The platform includes a private messaging system for students and tutors to communicate, negotiate rates, and arrange meeting locations. Payments can be made through Venmo, PayPal, or cash. After sessions, students can leave reviews to help others choose tutors.

The platform is built using React for the front-end and SQL, Node.js with Express for the back-end. It focuses on security, usability, and efficiency to provide a reliable tutoring experience.
