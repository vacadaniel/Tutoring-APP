#About Our Tutoring Platform

Our tutoring platform is designed to connect students with tutors within their own school, making academic support more accessible and convenient. Whether a student needs help preparing for an exam or mastering a challenging subject, our platform provides a streamlined way to find and book qualified tutors.

Tutors can easily create profiles, select the school they attend, list the subjects they specialize in, set hourly rates, and manage their availability. Students can browse a curated list of tutors from their school, filter based on subject and ratings, and schedule sessions at their convenience.

The platform includes an integrated private messaging system that allows students and tutors to communicate, negotiate rates, finalize meeting locations, and ensure a smooth tutoring experience. To facilitate seamless transactions, we support multiple payment methods, including Venmo, PayPal, and cash options. After each session, students can leave reviews to help maintain a high-quality tutoring network.

Built with a robust technical stack, including React for the front-end and Node.js with Express for the back-end, our platform offers a responsive, user-friendly interface. With a strong focus on security, efficiency, and usability, we aim to create a reliable and effective tutoring solution tailored for students and tutors within the same academic institutions.
